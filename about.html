      <p class="img__description">For my final three years of undergrad I was a member of the Ohio State University Men's Glee Club. As an ensemble, we travelled largely around Ohio, though extending to Michigan, Indiana, and West Virginia to perform
        and work with high school students on their choral education. Averaging 80 members, I also spent time within the smaller communications commitee, responsible for organizing communication within the ensemble, as well as
        to the outer community, and to our alumni network. My final year in the club, I was able to undertake a project with University Archives to create a display case of MGC artifacts, as the OSUMGC is proud to be the oldest continually
        operating student organization at The Ohio State University, being founded in 1875.</p>

    <div class="img__description_layer">
      <p class="img__description">In UMSI666 with Dr. Andrea Thomer, we were tasked with creating a metadata schema for a personal collection. I selected my grandfather's papers out of his career as the director of bands for 28
        years between 1966 and 1994 at Bowling Green State University. This is a multimedia collection, containing audio-recordings in as many formats as were used in that period, as well as photographs, and then teaching materials.
        The ultimate goal of the schema was to make it both interoperable with institutional metadata schema like DublinCore, but also easy enough to use that a non-archivist could describe the collection using it.

        Krakow, and Berlin. As it was up to us to arrange our travel in and out of Europe, many from our program went to Dublin, Ireland before the official program begin in London, and I personally travelled to Sierre, Switzerland Following
        the conclusion of our program in Berlin.

    <div class="img__description_layer">
      <p class="img__description">The program was structured such that from ~9 a.m. until ~ 2 p.m. we were at a site, such as The Imperial War Museum, Bletchley Park, Omaha Beach, Auschwitz/Birkenau, or the Bundestag, and then had the rest of the day to ourselves to explore whatever city we found ourselves.
        Along the way we were responsbile for publishing a series of travel blogs, where we interpreted the collective memory and presentation of public history from an array of perspectives, including as an American, or as a historian.
        Ultimately, the opportunity to dissect public history and its relationship with collective memory in the locations where the war was actually fought remains one of the most formative experiences I've had relating to my understanding of
        artifact preservation and presentation.
